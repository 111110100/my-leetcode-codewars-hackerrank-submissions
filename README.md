Tried some easy problems on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com), [codewars.com](https://codewars.com/) and [hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com) and see how well I did.

## Disclaimer
* I'm not a programmer by profession. I used to be but that was a different time.
* All code are in Python because it's the easiest for me to learn.
* With some problems, I had to look up some hints provided by leetcode.
* I'm sure you're better than me.
